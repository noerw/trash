# NUTS geodata

EU standardized geographic regions for statistical applications.
See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature_of_Territorial_Units_for_Statistics).

While the data is provided [here](http://nuts.geovocab.org/) as KML, it is very slow to access, and does not provide CORS headers.
Instead local data access is fast.
